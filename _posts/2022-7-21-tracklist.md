## show me the way / forget how to feel
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Only the strongest will survive  
But you yourself are nothing so divine

Lead me to heaven when we die  
Just next in line

I am a shadow on the wall  
Arm yourself because no one else

<div class="float" markdown="1">

as I said

there was

no other way

</div>
</div>


## blame all your weakness on me / set fire to us all
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

My ship is sinking but it's  
Feed the rich and kill the poor  

All good and I can go down  
Turn out the lights and just ignore  

Keep pretending like the party's all over  
What's going on outside

<div class="float" markdown="1">

you will give

until you are nothing

and that is strength

</div>
</div>

## those gods, they're so hard to believe / if i fail, if i rise
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Somebody has to keep justice intact  
Surely it's a waste of time

Somebody has to get stabbed in the back  
You hold me highly, I suppose it's fine

It's for a good cause  
I feel worthy 'cause I've gained your trust

<div class="float" markdown="1">

if there are further tragedies

it is only until

they are not necessary

</div>
</div>

## this time, i'll get it right / no more fighting, no more pain
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

I'll rip and smash through the hornet's nest  
With the plan certified by faith

Don't you understand I deserve the best?  
And a plan written in death, at that moment

Gonna do what I want, do what I please  
This was it, he took his last breath

<div class="float" markdown="1">

and here you come

with venom

on your tongue

</div>
</div>

## most of you have gone away / but in the deafness of my world
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

It's the nexus of the crisis  
Follow me down to the valley below, you know

And the origin of storms  
Moonlight is bleeding

Just the place to hopelessly encounter time  
From out of your soul

<div class="float" markdown="1">

your father and I,

we had our duty,

and then each other

</div>
</div>

## when every man is torn apart / you stopped me from blinking
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Will no one lay the laurel wreath  
But you, amplified in the silence  

When silence drowns the screams?  
Justified in the way you make me bruise

Between the iron gates of fate  
Magnified in the science

<div class="float" markdown="1">

he left -

begged them to teach you

what I could not

</div>
</div>
