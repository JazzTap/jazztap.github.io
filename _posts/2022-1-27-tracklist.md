dream theater - in the presence of enemies pt.1

queens of the stone age - the vampyre of time and memory

redemption - and yet  
the hint - hidden track

opeth - face of melinda

## conceded pain in crumbling mirth / the phoenix says
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

All faith forever has been washed away  
She asked exactly

I returned for you in great dismay  
Tell me what is love,

Come with me, far away to stay  
But breathing life alone

<div class="float" markdown="1">

looking back on us

it didn't work

and never could

</div>
</div>

## now our merge is eternal / a symbol of my faith
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart  
I can lead you down the path, and back to life

I can see through the scars inside you  
All I ask is that you worship me

Can't you see that you're lost without me?  
I can help you seek revenge, and save yourself

<div class="float" markdown="1">

you promised me love

that even i

could be saved

</div>
</div>

## while we fight for our lives / and see what's right
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

This time dear  
Wish that I could rewind and start over

This time I know we'll do it right  
These thoughts, still they dwell in my mind

Fall deeper and deeper in our precious lie  
I'm losing a battle I thought I had already won

<div class="float" markdown="1">

i struggled

against the world

for you

</div>
</div>

## give me a shot to remember / 'cause I feel no love
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

And the lust it commands  
Who are you to me

Drop the dagger and lather  
Who am I supposed to be,

The blood on your hands, Romeo  
Not exactly sure anymore

<div class="float" markdown="1">

sometimes i thought

our great deeds

were just crimes

</div>
</div>

## we can never go back / even though it's gone
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Youâ€™re heedless and oblivious  
But I sing for only you

Or maybe only cold  
I take a bow on the final cue

And I curse myself for caring  
The lights go down on me and you

<div class="float" markdown="1">

and then i thought

you knew nothing

about love

</div>
</div>

## then I don't want to know / and though I don't know why
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

I will always be your true friend   
I just can't let it die

If you want to fly  
'cause her heart's just like mine

Then I'll meet you there   
She holds her pain inside

<div class="float" markdown="1">

i don't blame you

that won't

make you better

</div>
</div>
