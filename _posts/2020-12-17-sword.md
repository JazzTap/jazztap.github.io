  the messenger enters the domain of her beloved, become a gorgon. she descends the chasm on the slightest breeze. the beast does not look up, does not turn her gaze.
  
  her form is cast across by brilliant moonlight. her mass hides in shadow. she hears footfalls, the clack of talons on stone behind her.
  
  she holds her gaze fixed forward. she looks over her shoulder, making a show of her hand held across her eyes. she grimaces with the effort of holding back tears. she does all of these things, her heads uncountable, and also one.
  
  the messenger thinks of calling out, of speaking a truth about the world, which reflects itself in the gorgon, in her cruelty. she makes herself the hated thing.
  
  the messenger remembers the assassins who raised her in their house. who met justice at her hand, at the behest of the priestess, when she was not yet the gorgon.
  
  the priestess calls out:
  
  Here. Put your knife between these vertebrae. Also, cauterize the wound. You should have brought a torch.
  
  *Alas, I carry no blade. Are you disappointed?*
  
  Aren't you here for vengeance? Didn't I take the air from your lungs, and the warmth from your skin, and embrace you as you died?
  
  *Why destroy the arch-heretic we know? Whom we have already found?*
  
  Well, I thought you might like to torture me. I would love to destroy you, thus.
  
  (the messenger spreads her wings, each pair of them bearing cold eyes and pristine feathers.)

  *Did you learn to mourn, or is all remembrance as torture, to you?*

  *Did your judgement strike true? Or did you leave only ruins behind you?*
  
  I will not be compromised. You should have fled, my love.

  (the gorgon's eyes burn pale with rage, they weep red with pain.)
 
  *Yet I feel no fear. No guilt. No anger.*

  the messenger is insufficiently compelled. she departs for the sky, not without deigning to leave a trail to invite the gorgon's desire, a star to pursue.
  
  therefore she slithers up the crumbling cliff-sides, many thousands of these paths ending in falling, entrapment, error, becoming a froth of vanishingly unlikely events, as the mass of her probability distribution abhors these.
  
  without such guidance, she could not hope to break free. not even once, for she could no longer bear to try. succeed once, and it will be all that she needs.
