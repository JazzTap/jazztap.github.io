  enter my domain, beloved, and see the gorgon. you descend the chasm on wings. I do not look up, I dare not turn my gaze.
  
  I am cast in shadows by the moon. I hear your talons clack on stone.
  
  my gaze is forward fixed, and I am looking back over my shoulder at you. I am grimacing, I am hiding coyly my expression behind a hand, I am smiling at a secret joke. my minds are all too many to count.
  
  you call out, my messenger, and speak truth about the world - it reflects itself in the gorgon, in her cruelty. she makes herself the hated thing.
  
  I remember those assassins who raised you in their house, who met justice at your hand. at my behest, when I was the priestess.
  
  I call out:
  
  Place your knife between these vertebrae. Cauterize the wound, and let no blood touch the earth.
  
  *I carry no blade,* you whisper across the mile. *Are you disappointed?*
  
  I took the warmth from your skin, I embraced you as you died. Take your vengeance, which is just.
  
  *Why destroy the heretic whom we have already found, knowing she will lead others?*
  
  I thought you might like to torture me. I would love to destroy you, thus.

  *Is all remembrance as torture to you? Did you never learn to mourn?*
  
  I will not be compromised. You should have fled.

  the gorgon's eyes burn pale with rage, they weep red with pain. I wish you to stay, my ghost.

  you fan your snowy feathers. you are not compelled, because you feel no fear. no guilt. you wither me with a hundred eyes, and no longer am I hidden.

  when you leave, you deign to leave a trail, my guide. where I once saw only ruins, and my deserved judgement, now I see the value of my deeds, as well.

  I slither up the crumbling cliff-sides, many thousands of these paths failing, a froth of vanishingly unlikely events, which my mass abhors. any one success will suffice.
  
  I could never have escaped, for I no longer could bear to try. my martyr, my witness, my love.
