  the messenger enters the domain of her beloved, become a gorgon. she descends the chasm on the slightest breeze. the beast does not look up, does not turn her gaze.
  
  her form is cast across by brilliant moonlight. her mass hides in shadow. she hears footfalls, the clack of talons on stone behind her.
  
  she holds her gaze fixed forward. she looks over her shoulder, making a show of her hand held across her eyes. she grimaces with the effort of holding back tears. she does all of these things, her heads uncountable, and also one.
  
  the messenger thinks of calling out, of speaking a truth about the world, which reflects itself in the gorgon, in her cruelty. she makes herself the hated thing.
  
  the messenger remembers the assassins who raised her in their house. who met justice at her hand, at the behest of the priestess, when she was not yet the gorgon.
  
  <br/>
  
  Here. Put your knife between these vertebrae. Also, cauterize the wound. You should have brought a torch.
  
  *I carry no blade. Are you disappointed?*
  
  Aren't you here for vengeance? Didn't I take the air from your lungs, and the warmth from your skin, and embrace you as you died?
  
  *Why destroy the arch-heretic we know? Whom we have already found?*
  
  Well, I thought you might like to torture me. I would love to destroy you, thus.
  
  (the messenger spreads her wings, each pair of the three bearing eyes, and pristine feathers.)

  *Did you learn to mourn, or is all remembrance as torture, to you?*

  I will not be compromised. You should have fled, my love.

  *Did your judgement strike true? Or did you leave only ruins behind you?*

  (the messenger meets the gorgon's eyes. they burn pale with rage, they weep red with pain. but they no longer compel.)
 
  *Yet I feel no fear. No guilt. No anger.*

  the messenger departs for the sky. not without deigning, though, to leave a trail to invite the gorgon's desire, a star to pursue.
  
  therefore she slithers up the crumbling cliff-sides, many thousands of paths ending in falling or becoming trapped by the earth, these all swallowed again by the vanishingly unlikely corners of her probability distribution.
  
  without this guidance, she could not hope to succeed. not even once, all that she needs, for she could no longer bear to try.
