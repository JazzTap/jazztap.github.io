  the messenger enters the domain of her beloved, become a gorgon. she descends the chasm on the slightest breeze. the beast does not look up, does not turn her gaze.
  
  her form is cast across by brilliant moonlight. her mass hides in shadow. she hears footfalls, the clack of talons on stone behind her.
  
  she holds her gaze fixed forward. she looks over her shoulder, making a show of her hand held across her eyes. she grimaces with the effort of holding back tears. she does all of these things, her heads uncountable, and also one.
  
  the messenger thinks of calling out, of speaking a truth about the world, which reflects itself in the gorgon, in her cruelty. she makes herself the hated thing.
  
  the messenger remembers the assassins who raised her in their house. who met justice at her hand, at the behest of the priestess, when she was not yet the gorgon.

  Here. Put your knife between these vertebrae. Also, cauterize the wound. You should have brought a torch.
  
  *I carry no blade. Are you disappointed?*
  
  Aren't you here for vengeance? Didn't I take the air from your lungs, and the warmth from your skin, and embrace you as you died?
  
  *Why destroy the arch-heretic we know? Whom we have already found?*
  
  I will not be compromised. You should have fled, my love.
  
  (the messenger meets her eyes, which petrify men. they burn pale with rage, they weep red with pain.)
  
  *Yet I feel no fear. No guilt. No anger.*
  
  I thought you might like to torture me. Perhaps to death, if it please you.
  
  *Did you learn to mourn, or is all remembrance as torture, to you?*
  
  (the messenger spreads her feathered wings, each pair set with eyes, in their dozens.)
  
  *Did your judgement strike true? Or did you leave only ruins behind you?*
