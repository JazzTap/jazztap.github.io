## Addendum - Research debt as political ecology

Can a field redefine itself out of research debt? Let's go up a level of abstraction. We were discussing models of objects of study. Let's discuss models of the kinds of objects that a field studies.

In her Plea for Slow Science, an example given by Stengers is that of chemistry as an academic discipline. When its curriculum was first developed, 'chemistry' could encompass a myriad of applied traditions that each took decades to master. It was impractical to teach these all in a four-year degree program. One chemist designed an accelerated curriculum that addressed the needs of industrial chemistry, and only its needs. As this sector was wildly profitable at the time, it would hire all their students immediately. Thus, chemistry became an academic monoculture, despite (and because of) its rich heritage from alchemy and womens' crafts. This is one way to avoid research debt, by not addressing it.

Stengers' lecture describes this as a 'cut' placed between chemical crafts and academic/industrial chemistry, and its consequences as an detachment of the science of chemistry from public life. She warns us of a situation where scientific protections are extended to industrial work, so that scientists who ask difficult questions are stopped from pursuing them. Industrial chemistry (i.e. at scale, using materials that may or may not be toxic) can only predominate a science which deliberately ignores situations that are contingent or complicated.

This should remind us presently of computer science and programming for tech companies, which are distinct disciplines, despite occupying the same degree program [cite]. When Allison Parrish makes a similar plea, "Toward a new hacker ethic", she identifies that all models and data about the world are made from 'cuts', i.e. choosing which parts of the world to forget, so that the rest may be understood.

[Aphorism bad!] It is always necessary to distinguish between forms of superstition and of long-honed intuition, and between historical contingency and actual differences in needs, to make a cut that yields data whose shape is good.
