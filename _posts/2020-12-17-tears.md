  the condition of being a woman is to yield, when it is asked. and to find worth in this act.
  
  put your wants aside, and listen. put your pride aside, and sacrifice. no, to sacrifice others? that is the right of men.
  
  (you won't lead by example, if they won't follow)
  
  we have the pathology of apology as sympathetic magic. if you have overstepped, you must realize, if only I apologize for the same thing.
  
  in exchange for yielding, you are exempt from coercion by men. through the protection of men. (no one wants to step into a domestic dispute. through the whispers of women, then.)

  you try protecting yourself. you will escape the threat of violence through greater violence.
  
  the apex predator is the ruler, the sovereign, the one who guarantees the freedom of their prey. their mercy, their severity, is the only justice.
  
  (strong women are not judged by the standards of men. their greatness cannot earn them the same excuses.)
  
  but your daughter has no taste for mercy, which is hard won.
