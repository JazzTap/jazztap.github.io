<div markdown="1" class="three-lines">
Well I want the best god  
Learning to swallow the rage

Yeah I want the biggest god  
Found a new girl, I think we can make it

But those gods are so hard to believe  
As long as she stays on the page

THE MOON:

broken promises, collapse

*adapt (cursive)  
space-dye vest (dream theater)*
</div>

# üêÖ
<div markdown="1" class="three-lines">
Justified in the way you make me bruise  
Bombs and greed prox-imity and

Magnified in the science  
Contrary, and chaos, chaos...

Anatomically proved that you don't need me  
Bright and clear in times you'll see

DEATH:

self-hatred, punishment

*the silence (manchester orchestra)  
turn of the tide (sylvan)*
</div>

# üéØ
<div markdown="1" class="three-lines">
I have to know your name  
Is there nothing left to steal?

Where have I seen your face before?  
Crying out for something more than I‚Äôve been shown

My dear, why don't you be afraid?  
Knowing none of this is real

JUSTICE:

irreducible conflict of interests

*forsaken (dream theater)  
cry of achilles (alter bridge)*
</div>

# ‚öõ
<div markdown="1" class="three-lines">
Freedom lies in your own desires  
There's silver in your lungs now

Freedom lives in your will  
And all I care about is shapes

Nothing's left as we're reaching higher  
And all I care about is colours

STRENGTH:

immortal legacy, self-destruction

*covenant (soen)  
your body is a machine (the good natured)*
</div>

# üè∫
<div markdown="1" class="three-lines">
Kingdom of Gold now lay at my feet -  
Question all you trust, buy into the fear

Ruler of Time and Space I will be  
I see the man ripping at my soul now, I -

Rivers of lies forever will run -   
I know the man, I know him all too well

TEMPERANCE:

to be redeemed before an ancestor, reformation

*egypt (symphony x)  
this means war (avenged sevenfold)*
</div>
