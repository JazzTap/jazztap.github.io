<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
  (my eyes, my eyes, my fucking eyes)  
  Hypocrite, how could you be so cruel

  Calling, calling out  
  And expect my faith in return?

  The darkness reaches up my soul,  
  Resistance is not as hard as it seems
  
THE SUN:

deeply held belief, expedient teachings

*slow burn (atreyu)  
the mirror (dream theater)*

## 💥  
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
And my way out of the dark  
"Believe? In a deity long dead? -

I wanna set the skies on fire  
I would rather be a pagan suckled in creeds outworn;

And watch the angels as they fall into the sun  
With faerytales fill'd up in head;

JUDGEMENT:

fetishizing the other, seeking guidance

*amanes (tiamat)  
when he falleth (theater of tragedy)*

## 🚣  
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
In delicate equilibrium  
You're my everything, you're my angel

Watching in revulsion the oblivious crowd  
You're the vision that I take with me every step

Taking control of this world  
Been searching for your vibration

THE STAR:

what will be, but is not

*urban migration (xavier samuel)  
the balance (knight area)*

## 🗲  
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
Judge me now  
Save a mist on the rise

Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down  
A final blessing to hide

A king in my own mind  
Her ghost in the fog

THE TOWER:

conquest, victory in war

*the quiet place (in flames)  
her ghost in the fog (cradle of filth)*

## ⚗  
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
To burn, ignite, I’d do it for so much less  
Desperation, better be

When all is made clear there is nothing else  
Setting sail in a stormy sea

And here we stand, the sweet arresting duality  
Alone against humanity

THE DEVIL:

to honor those sacrificed, revolution

*my dark disquiet (poets of the fall)  
the weight of disaster (leprous)*
