## 🙏 The Sun
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
  (my eyes, my eyes, my fucking eyes)  
  Hypocrite, how could you be so cruel

  Calling, calling out  
  And expect my faith in return?

  The darkness reaches up my soul,  
  Resistance is not as hard as it seems
  
<div class="float" markdown="1">
deeply held belief

expedient teachings

*slow burn (atreyu)  
the mirror (dream&nbsp;theater)*
</div>

## 💥 Judgement
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
And my way out of the dark  
"Believe? In a deity long dead? -

I wanna set the skies on fire  
I would rather be a pagan suckled in creeds outworn;

And watch the angels as they fall into the sun  
With faerytales fill'd up in head;

<div class="float" markdown="1">
fetishizing the other

seeking guidance

*amanes (tiamat)  
when he falleth (theater&nbsp;of&nbsp;tragedy)*
</div>

## 🚣 The Star
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
In delicate equilibrium  
You're my everything, you're my angel

Watching in revulsion the oblivious crowd  
You're the vision that I take with me every step

Taking control of this world  
Been searching for your vibration

<div class="float" markdown="1">
what will be, but is not

cyclical relationships

*urban migration (xavier&nbsp;samuel)  
the balance (knight&nbsp;area)*
</div>

## 🗲 The Tower
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
Judge me now  
Save a mist on the rise

Used to be afraid to let it show, bow down  
A final blessing to hide

A king in my own mind  
Her ghost in the fog

<div class="float" markdown="1">
victory in war

reason in mystery

*the quiet place (in&nbsp;flames)  
her ghost in the fog (cradle&nbsp;of&nbsp;filth)*
</div>

## ⚗ The Devil
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">
To burn, ignite, I’d do it for so much less  
Desperation, better be

When all is made clear there is nothing else  
Setting sail in a stormy sea

And here we stand, the sweet arresting duality  
Alone against humanity

<div class="float" markdown="1">
to honor those sacrificed

revolution

*my dark disquiet (poets&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;fall)  
the weight of disaster (leprous)*
</div>
