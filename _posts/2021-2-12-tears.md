  the condition of being a woman is to yield, when it is asked. and to find worth in this act.
  
  put your wants aside, and listen. put your pride aside, and sacrifice. no, to sacrifice others? that is the right of men.
  
  (you won't lead by example, if they won't follow)
  
  we have the pathology of apology as sympathetic magic. if you have overstepped, you must realize, if only I apologize for the same thing.
  
  in exchange for yielding, you are exempt from coercion. you are protected, you are warned, maybe, in time.

  you try protecting yourself, to do it all yourself. you will escape the threat of violence through greater violence. to become sovereign, to protect against other predators.

  the world is cruel.
  
  you are judged, not as a man would be. you survive, you surmount life, you leave weakness behind.
  
  you are strong.
