still corners - i wrote in blood  
halsey - control  

lacuna coil - our truth  
chevelle - jars  

swallow the sun - stone wings  
nightwish - ghost river  

<div class="float" markdown="1">

knight area - the balance  
david draiman - forsaken  

royal hunt - another man down  
the foreshadowing - the wandering  

kongos - i'm only joking  
pure reason revolution - the twyncyn

## fell asleep in your embrace / should be scared of me
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

We can leave now, just drive away  
The hallways, they echoed and groaned

Only you and me, we could leave today  
I sat alone, in bed till the morning

Let's take a chance, like we used to  
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"

<div class="float" markdown="1">
hear my plea

i did as you asked

it wasn't supposed to bleed

</div>
</div>


## time to forget / steal from yourselves
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Nothing else they can do
You're stabbing you through him  

To turn it back
And betting most of this world  

Breaking partnership
We'll add enough of the whole world  

<div class="float" markdown="1">
i am not well

but my friend will return

with the medicine

</div>
</div>

## the river flows deep / we live as we dream
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

The fires are burning, under starlight  
Death by a thousand cuts

Through veils of golden light  
Believe it, we live as we dream

The sails so pure, so white  
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down

<div class="float" markdown="1">
did you see my friend

he was killed?

no, i didn't -

</div>
</div>

## a sanctified gift / at last i see
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Hallowing the martyrs  
You see I'm falling in the vast abyss

Who right before them fell  
Clouded by memories of the past

Chanting names of gods  
At last I see

<div class="float" markdown="1">
i am not a victim,

only a cursed stranger

i draw forth a long tooth

</div>
</div>

## and i am this / what you're doing
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

But far behind me - I'm flying -  
Our souls are not ready for life

Somebody else's body hits the ground  
We're gonna have a fight

I'm moving away... or just trying?  
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies 

<div class="float" markdown="1">
i gnaw through at the root

my dagger shape shown

hidden, alone

</div>
</div>

## the earth is alive / braving his warm smile
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

And heavenly bodies make us fight  
I'll leave it behind & sleep with the rhymes

I'm only joking  
It raptured the soul & all that is now

I don't believe a thing I said  
Was done & to come how everything thunders my son

<div class="float" markdown="1">
you said, return to man

and do not forget my gift

for i adore your wickedness

</div>
</div>
