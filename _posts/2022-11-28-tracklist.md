still corners - i wrote in blood  
halsey - control  

lacuna coil - our truth  
chevelle - jars  

swallow the sun - stone wings  
nightwish - ghost river  

<div class="float" markdown="1">

knight area - the balance  
david draiman - forsaken  

royal hunt - another man down  
the foreshadowing - the wandering  

kongos - i'm only joking  
pure reason revolution - the twyncyn

## they sent me away to find them a fortune
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

We can leave now, just drive away  
The hallways, they echoed and groaned

Only you and me, we could leave today  
I sat alone, in bed till the morning

Let's take a chance, like we used to  
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"

<div class="float" markdown="1">
hear my plea

i did as you asked

it wasn't supposed to bleed

</div>
</div>


## clock is ticking while i'm still in time
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Nothing else they can do to turn it back  
You're stabbing you through him  

Breaking partnership in this crime  
And betting most of this world  

Ripping up the past, condescending smile  
We'll add enough of the whole world  

<div class="float" markdown="1">
i am not well

but my friend will return

with the medicine

</div>
</div>

## you sing to me, the river flows deep
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

The fires are burning, under starlight  
Death by a thousand cuts

Through veils of golden light  
Believe it, we live as we dream

The sails so pure, so white  
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down

<div class="float" markdown="1">
did you see my friend

he was killed?

no, i didn't -

</div>
</div>

## a sanctified gift from your gods
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Hallowing the martyrs  
You see I'm falling in the vast abyss

Who right before them fell  
Clouded by memories of the past

Chanting names of gods  
At last I see

<div class="float" markdown="1">
i am not a victim,

only a cursed stranger

i draw forth a long tooth

</div>
</div>

## and i am this, another man down
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

But far behind me - I'm flying -  
Our souls are not ready for life

Somebody else's body hits the ground  
We're gonna have a fight

I'm moving away... or just trying?  
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies 

<div class="float" markdown="1">
i gnaw through at the root

my dagger shape shown

hidden, alone

</div>
</div>

## the earth is alive and man is a parasite
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

And heavenly bodies make us fight  
I'll leave it behind & sleep with the rhymes

I'm only joking  
It raptured the soul & all that is now

I don't believe a thing I said  
Was done & to come how everything thunders my son

<div class="float" markdown="1">
you said, return to man

and do not forget my gift

for i adore your wickedness

</div>
</div>
