still corners - i wrote in blood  
halsey - control  

in sumerian haze - sirenia  
our truth - lacuna coil

nightwish - ghost river  
knight area - the balance  

<div class="float" markdown="1">

swallow the sun - stone wings  
chevelle - jars  

kongos - i'm only joking  
pure reason revolution - the twyncyn

## I'm colder than this home
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

We can leave now, just drive away  
The hallways, they echoed and groaned

Only you and me, we could leave today  
I sat alone, in bed till the morning

Let's take a chance, like we used to  
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"

<div class="float" markdown="1">

</div>
</div>


## Condescending smile, time to forget 
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Profoundly deranged you go  
Can't you turn it back?

Through another day  
Stop the cycle set me free, run away

I guess it was meant to be this way  
Silence sneaking around my path

<div class="float" markdown="1">

</div>
</div>

## Snow white, pitch-black, your life such strife
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Never met a kinder heart than yours  
Spinning your wheels of fortune

Let it bleed  
Playing with powers you cannot comprehend

Leave a footprint on every island you see  
But when all cards have been played

<div class="float" markdown="1">

</div>
</div>

## We'll add enough of the whole world
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Walls will crumble in  
We can't both become the same pawn

And skies open  
That's made to fall

And when you speak  
Oil that tastes like blood

<div class="float" markdown="1">

</div>
</div>

## Set the stars alight, beneath them ease their minds
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

And heavenly bodies make us fight  
I'll leave it behind & sleep with the rhymes

I'm only joking  
It raptured the soul & all that is now

I don't believe a thing I said  
Was done & to come how everything thunders my son

<div class="float" markdown="1">
