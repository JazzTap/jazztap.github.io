still corners - i wrote in blood  
halsey - control  

lacuna coil - our truth  
chevelle - jars  

swallow the sun - stone wings  
nightwish - ghost river  

<div class="float" markdown="1">

knight area - the balance  
david draiman - forsaken  

royal hunt - another man down  
the foreshadowing - the wandering  

kongos - i'm only joking  
pure reason revolution - the twyncyn

We can leave now, just drive away  
The hallways, they echoed and groaned

Only you and me, we could leave today  
I sat alone, in bed till the morning

Let's take a chance, like we used to  
I'm crying, "They're coming for me"

<div class="float" markdown="1">

## 
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Come and tease me  
We'll add enough of the whole world

Clock is ticking while I'm still in time  
Is the main thing you'll shout

Can't you turn it back?  
'Til the bitter end

<div class="float" markdown="1">

## 
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

The fires are burning, under starlight  
Death by a thousand cuts

Through veils of golden light  
Believe it, we live as we dream

The sails so pure, so white  
He will go down he will drown drown, deeper down

<div class="float" markdown="1">

## 
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

Hallowing the martyrs  
You see I'm falling in the vast abyss

Who right before them fell  
Clouded by memories of the past

Chanting names of gods  
At last I see

## 
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

But far behind me - I'm flying -  
Our souls are not ready for life

Somebody else's body hits the ground  
We're gonna have a fight

I'm moving away... or just trying?  
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies 

<div class="float" markdown="1">


</div>
</div>

## the earth is alive and man is a parasite / did she breathe through waking
<div markdown="1" class="grid three-lines">

And heavenly bodies make us fight  
I'll leave it behind & sleep with the rhymes

I'm only joking  
It raptured the soul & all that is now

I don't believe a thing I said  
Was done & to come how everything thunders my son
