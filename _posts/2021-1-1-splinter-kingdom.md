### Sir Justin

[figure of a knight ]

### Slobberchomps

[figure of a winged cat with pearlescent eyes]

### Beleth

[figure of a tiefling with cat ears, arguing with the mayor]

### Balakog

[figure of an orc with mismatched eyes and skeletal wings]

Being lost in the dungeon, Balakog was rescued by the vampire orcs of the Underquorum. They sought to convince him that the Orc Lord fully endorsed their actions in Hell on his behalf, realizing the bard was loyal, despite his travails. They could even cite common cause, in destroying the Cult of the Devourer, which sought control of the dungeon to hasten its apotheosis.

If Balakog chose to join the Underquorum, based on his faith in the Orc Lord, then he likely became involved in the raids against Dungeon Town. Possibly the cryostasis used to preserve his life began to fail, due to the new laws of magic, although the vampires could have found some means to sustain it.

### Krievan

### Idyll

[figure of a winged valkyrie, embracing an unadorned shield]

One night, Idyll departed Dungeon Town with the shield bearing Krievan's soul, avoiding entirely both Slobberchomps' haunts and Beleth's hut. For Dungeon Town could not sustain itself against the Underquorum's siege without negotiations. And she could not bring them to the table without leverage.

Therefore, she had plotted to retrieve the body of Krievan from the Flesh Tailor's clutches. (Something sets a trap for Idyll. She cannot resist the call to save her true love! Wait, yes she can. Lair of the Flesh Tailor first, stupid plan later.)

How Idyll should have convinced the Flesh Tailor is unclear. Blackmail? Service? Self-sacrifice? It is clear that Idyll never returned to Dungeon Town, so perhaps she did reach Heaven.

Or, whatever it is she did, she could bear to not face her friends afterward.

RAHEL: Oh, you don't think she knows you? That she could trust you, after you handed her your own mother?  
RAHEL: Krievan cares about people. I don't mean people you know, people, I mean people in the world. Who are bastards, as you know.

RAHEL: The real question here is, who will you get the leverage to free her from?  
RAHEL: You could go back to Maggy! She's great. She's really awful. How perfect. Super instrumental.

RAHEL: I mean, obviously you betray the custodian and take their power, regardless of who you pick. That's real endgame here.  
RAHEL: You don't want to stay in Dungeon Town.

IDYLL: Yes, and I suppose the Devourer is the safest place I could be in all this?  
IDYLL: Weren't you all about breaking Hell, last month? The cycle of damnation entire?

RAHEL: They might've forgot, I'm starting to feel like. But you? You remember Krievan's big plan.

IDYLL: Was it, though? Hers, I mean?  
IDYLL: Wait, that's why you won't help me get her back. She'd wreck your mom's scheme all over again.

RAHEL: You could guess that the Diabolist had her hand in this one. I won't deny it.  
RAHEL: Come up here and we'll talk about it.

IDYLL: You ran back to her, after everything? Knowing everything she did, as Zariel?  
IDYLL: You know what, fuck off! Enough with the voicemails.

IDYLL: I would like to simply enjoy my break from the entire goddamn Splinter Kingdom in peace.  
IDYLL: It's not a fate. Almost certainly not.


# Pamphlet: The Gods and You

The Gods of Life, Death, and the Balance are honored in public during the morning, and in private during the night. Sadly, most rituals in public circulation regarding the propitiation of the Dark Gods must be considered as malicious nonsense.

(the Diabolist isn't just about creating problems on purpose, but even more, empowering people to make their own. it's not so much 'look at what I did', but more like, 'look what you did'.

otoh the Great Gold does almost nothing, and takes credit for everything. did Krievan's friends show up in time to help her? must be the grace of the Wyrm. 'he works in mysterious ways'.)

## The Great Gold Wyrm / Tiamat

> Clerics of the Wyrm will say that a valkyrie restored life to Krievan, the Champion of the Damned, who was then restored from Hell to her true station in Heaven. It is less clear what happened to the valkyrie - despite lengthy scenes of the Champion's warm welcome to Heaven, and subsequent drunken celebration, her companion does not appear again.

## Ralishaz / Ut'Ulls-Hr'Her

## Sif / Gruumsh

## Shinare / Scathac

## Trithereon / Aphrodite

These are both gods of great heroes, which is to say, events you want to happen to someone else. Trithereon is more about great justice, Aphrodite is more into great glory.



## Groth-Golka / Toth

## Savras / Ptar-Axtlan
