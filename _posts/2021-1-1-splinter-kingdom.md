### Sir Justin

[figure of a knight ]

### Slobberchomps

[figure of a winged cat with pearlescent eyes]

### Beleth

[figure of a tiefling with cat ears, arguing with the mayor]

### Balakog

[figure of an orc with mismatched eyes and skeletal wings]

Being lost in the dungeon, Balakog was rescued by the vampire orcs of the Underquorum. They sought to convince him that the Orc Lord fully endorsed their actions in Hell on his behalf, realizing the bard was loyal, despite his travails. They could even cite common cause, in destroying the Cult of the Devourer, which sought control of the dungeon to hasten its apotheosis.

If Balakog chose to join the Underquorum, based on his faith in the Orc Lord, then he likely became involved in the raids against Dungeon Town. Possibly the cryostasis used to preserve his life began to fail, due to the new laws of magic, although the vampires could have found some means to sustain it.

### Idyll

[figure of a winged valkyrie, embracing an unadorned shield]

One night, Idyll departed Dungeon Town with Krievan's shield, bypassing entirely Slobberchomps' usual haunts and Beleth's hut on the outskirts. She had convinced herself that Dungeon Town could not sustain itself against orcish incursion without negotiation. But without the aid of the Great Gold Wyrm, she had nothing to bring them to the table with. Therefore, she should retrieve the body of Krievan from the Flesh Tailor's clutches.

(Along the way, Idyll is forced to choose between locating the lair of the Flesh Tailor, or diverting to rescue Rahel, who seems to have been captured while executing on a very stupid plan. Idyll can't do anything about that, she decides, flummoxing the psychic predator which laid out that bait.)

How Idyll should have convinced the Flesh Tailor to release the body of Krievan is unclear. It is clear that Idyll never returned to Dungeon Town, so she either did reach Heaven - or perhaps, whatever it is she found in the Devourer, she could not face her friends afterward.

(The Flesh Tailor can be convinced to take on a skilled chirurgeon to maintain their forces. This is fortunate, as Idyll has nothing to trade for Krievan's body but her own service.)

### Krievan



# Pamphlet: The Gods and You

The Gods of Life, Death, and the Balance are honored in public during the morning, and in private during the night. Sadly, most rituals in public circulation regarding the propitiation of the Dark Gods must be considered as malicious nonsense.

(the Diabolist isn't just about creating problems on purpose, but even more, empowering people to make their own. it's not so much 'look at what I did', but more like, 'look what you did'.

otoh the Great Gold does almost nothing, and takes credit for everything. did Krievan's friends show up in time to help her? must be the grace of the Wyrm. 'he works in mysterious ways'.)

## The Great Gold Wyrm / Tiamat

> Clerics of the Wyrm will say that a valkyrie restored life to Krievan, the Champion of the Damned, who was then restored from Hell to her true station in Heaven. It is less clear what happened to the valkyrie - despite lengthy scenes of the Champion's warm welcome to Heaven, and subsequent drunken celebration, her companion does not appear again.

## Ralishaz / Ut'Ulls-Hr'Her

## Sif / Gruumsh

## Shinare / Scathac

## Trithereon / Aphrodite

These are both gods of great heroes, which is to say, events you want to happen to someone else. Trithereon is more about great justice, Aphrodite is more into great glory.



## Groth-Golka / Toth

## Savras / Ptar-Axtlan
