it has been pointed out to me that twitter is not an archival solution. however, kudos to art twitter for the retrospective idea.

here's one piece from each month. (January? I don't recall a January.) since I don't paint every month, some dates are fudged.

spring quarter features some of the player characters from tabletop campaign, which has been ongoing through voice calls.

summer quarter features [more tabletop art]({% post_url 2020-09-04-love-story %}). I'm very excited about drawing feathered wings *and* staring eyes, I gotta say.

fall quarter, I'm revisiting other characters from exul mater, now that it's all done. and looking forward to [new retellings]({% post_url 2020-12-17-sword %}).

oh, there's a lego addendum below, which covers the gaps in Jul and Sep/Oct that I slid stuff onto.

I've got a snake from july, who came wih us fleeing the wildfire.

campaign lore, there was an argument about who should grab the sword which kills you. my character got frustrated and tried it. she died. it brought her back.

she used that sword once, maybe twice. she tried to bring the vatborn monstrosities back from extinction, as weapons, too. I like to think she turned it into a viper like them, after.
