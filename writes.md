# Resume Todo

I have two course transcripts between four transcript entries (transfer work, BS, MS, PhD). I will split up the latter manually.

* Update CV.
	* > Include urls of abstracts or reprints of any papers you have published in journals or presented at conferences on your resume with your online application. Examples of our research are available.

	* Link geobiology and scipy materials. Don't forget msri, arxiv.
	* Include departmental awards.


# Statement Todo

* Saddle points in idea space.
* Fractal depth of specialization.

* Review portfolio reqs.
	> Computational Media MS/PhD and Games & Playable Media MS Program applicants are expected to include a link to their online portfolio.

* prof. forbes

## Research Items
    
<h3>biological pattern formation</h3>
<p>The genetics of an organism define only specific proteins and a control flow on them. Yet this suffices to determine the form and function of an entire organism, owing to the richness of reaction-diffusion dynamics in the developing embryo.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Survey of selected topics in, pending cleanup. <a href="./research/Pattern Formation Refs.pdf">References</a> available in the meantime.</li>
    <li>Related computational tools:
        <ul>
        <li>Shape metrics, e.g. modified Hausdorff distance.</li>
        <li>Swarm optimization, i.e. agent-based shortest-path finding.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h3>emergence in population ecology</h3>
<p>We see also surprisingly rich dynamics in biological populations, which persist only under certain constraints (which, of course, most extant communities satisfy).</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="./research/honcap.pdf">Draft of a paper</a> in which oscillations in a predator-prey system are stabilized by diffusion.
        <ul>
            <li>WIP: Compare agent-based model to a discrete-population, stochastic-rate model.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>WIP: Quantification of stochastic (environmental) effects on species isoclines & steady states.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>emergence in cliodynamics</h3>
<p>That which applies to populations of other species applies also to humans, with the added complication of a very rapid and flexible process of memetic evolution.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Simulation of models from cliodynamics / quantitative history, e.g. of cultural speciation.</li>
</ul>
    
<h3>cognition & 'learning'</h3>
<p>Just as the unit of biologically transmissible information is the gene (existing in a context of promoters, inhibitors, etc.), so the unit of socially transmissible information is termed the meme (existing in a context of norms, technology, etc.).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spatial effects in a network of agents possessing argumentation logic and arguing with each other.</li>
    <li>Narratives as the unit of experience; parsing, generation of.
        <ul>
            <li>Given content-words, procedurally generate sentences via SLR parser.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
