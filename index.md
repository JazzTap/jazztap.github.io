Jasmine Otto is a computational mathematician interested in reifications of complex systems, especially through constellated scientific practice, involving the rhetorics of dimensionality reduction and data visualization, as well as narrative and improvisational contexts. She is exploring the role of computational creativity in these sociotechnical ecologies, including existing and future uses of casual creator support and narrated explorable models.

Her creative writing is influenced by the lightness of nature's proving qualities, and the retelling of myths as grounding for uncivilization.

She studied mathematical biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and is now a PhD student in the Creative Coding Lab at UC Santa Cruz. This is her sketchblog of code, and some other theories.
