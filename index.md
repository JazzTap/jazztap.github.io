### Demos
<a href="./neuron_web/neuron.html">Generalized Fitz-Hugh Nagumo model</a> of an axon.

#### Pending For Web
Procedural generation of iterated fractals and fictional maps. Parameter tuning via artificial selection.

Predator-prey dynamics with spatial effects (and possibly handling time). Comparison of discrete and continuous cases.

### Technical Considerations
* agent-based (stochastic) simulations vs. dynamical systems
* numerical methods vs. direct (symbolic) analysis

## Research Items

    
<h3>biological pattern formation</h3>
    <p>The genetics of an organism define only specific proteins and a control flow on them. Yet this suffices to determine the form and function of an entire organism, owing to the richness of reaction-diffusion dynamics in the developing embryo.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Survey of selected topics in, pending cleanup. <a href="./research/Pattern Formation Refs.pdf">References</a> available in the meantime.</li>
        <li>Related computational tools:
            <ul>
            <li>Shape metrics, e.g. modified Hausdorff distance.</li>
            <li>Swarm optimization, i.e. agent-based shortest-path finding.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>emergence in population ecology</h3>
    <p>We see also surprisingly rich dynamics in biological populations, which persist only under certain constraints (which, of course, most extant communities satisfy).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./research/honcap.pdf">Draft of a paper</a> in which oscillations in a predator-prey system are stabilized by diffusion.
            <ul>
                <li>WIP: Compare agent-based model to a discrete-population, stochastic-rate model.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>WIP: Quantification of stochastic (environmental) effects on species isoclines & steady states.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>emergence in cliodynamics</h3>
    <p>That which applies to populations of other species applies also to humans, with the added complication of a very rapid and flexible process of memetic evolution.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulation of models from cliodynamics / quantitative history, e.g. of cultural speciation.</li>
    </ul>
    
<h3>cognition & 'learning'</h3>
    <p>Just as the unit of biologically transmissible information is the gene (existing in a context of promoters, inhibitors, etc.), so the unit of socially transmissible information is termed the meme (existing in a context of norms, technology, etc.).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spatial effects in a network of agents possessing argumentation logic and arguing with each other.</li>
        <li>Narratives as the unit of experience; parsing, generation of.
            <ul>
                <li>Given content-words, procedurally generate sentences via SLR parser.</li>
            </ul>
