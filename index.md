IAMA mathematical ecologist, ask me about cybernetics.

### Cognition
I code science for the web. Consider how [a neuronal axon](/research/neuron_web/) transmits an electrical signal.

I've investigated procedural generation of fictional maps like poetry, and iterated fractals under artificial selection. Parameter tuning via a human-in-the-loop.

### Geometry
Apollonius' circle problem.

### Patterning
Rugs and morphogenesis. Shader code.

### Mathematics
I began in mathematical biology by studying individual-based predator-prey dynamics (another nonlinear model) as the population approaches infinity (n -> oo), but remains much smaller than e.g. particles in the air. Notably, self-limitation alone makes a population model nonlinear, hence much less tractable to direct analysis, which suggests numerical investigation.

<div class=”sidenote”>When your model predicts 10^{-18} foxes in the population's stable limit cycle - that is, a population of this miniscule size will never go extinct - something is absurd.

These *attofoxes* are an artifact of assuming *n* continuum-large (as numerous as particles in the air). In fact, small systems of individuals are inherently noisy, prone to sampling error. One conclusion is that isolated populations can and will perish in a black-swan catastrophe, so that migration between habitats ('eggs in more than one basket') is necessary for conservation.</div>

But to document a numerical inquiry satisfactorily requires an intimate correspondence between equations, experimental method, and code. The notebook paragdim is the most satisfactory approach I've come across, not least because Jupyter notebooks (unlike Matlab, which requires a proprietary viewer) can be *freely shared* online.

<div class=”sidenote”>No amount of information is satisfactory without context - consider any Wikipedia article from a technical discipline adjacent to yours. Yet academic and scientific cultures have traditionally been bottlenecked by college acceptance (and the cost of tuition, and the distracted advisors caught in publish-or-perish...), even though without their uniquely evidence-based reasoning, we browse blindly or according to authority alone.</div>
