 

My computational media research supports academic and scientific work on complex systems models with humane interfaces. That is, I aim to improve user experiences of science, through computation - at all levels of expertise. 

Besides collaborating as a data scientist, my own artificial life models use human-in-the-loop generative design to explore principles such as local agents producing global order (collective behavior), and qualitative differences from small perturbations (catastrophe theory), which together produce lifelike emergent phenomena.

I studied mathematical biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and am now a PhD student in the Creative Coding Lab at UC Santa Cruz.

**tl;dr**
I am a mathematical ecologist, ask me about cybernetics. I sketch science with code, and this is my portfolio blog.
