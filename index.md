IAMA mathematical ecologist, ask me about cybernetics.

<sidenote>Cognition</sidenote>

I code science for the web. Consider how [a neuron transmits](/research/neuron_web/) an electrical signal, and thereby biochemistry participates in circuitry (1/2 ways). Instead of gates built out of transistors, voltage is summed at the neural dendrites.

I've investigated procedural generation of fictional maps like poetry, and iterated fractals under artificial selection. Parameter tuning via a human-in-the-loop.

[Apollonius' circle problem](https://github.com/JazzTap/mcs563/blob/master/README.md) asks which circles are tangent to all of three given circles. Although the system of equations is nonlinear, it certainly has eight complex solutions, whose real part we can draw in real-time. By dragging input circles across catastrophes, a beautiful geometric continuity is evinced.

I began in mathematical biology by studying [individual-based predator-prey dynamics](research/honcap.pdf) as the population approaches infinity (n -> oo), but remains much smaller than e.g. particles in the air. Notably, self-limitation alone makes a population model nonlinear, even though it emerges readily from the individual-based dynamics under appropriate assumptions.

<small>As a counterexample, when your model predicts 10^{-18} foxes in the population's stable limit cycle - that is, a population of this miniscule size will never go extinct - something is absurd. These *attofoxes* are an artifact of assuming *n* continuum-large (as numerous as particles in the air). In fact, small systems of individuals are inherently noisy, prone to sampling error. </small>
  
<small>Similar accidents of discretization are a fact of life, in contradiction to control-theoretic optimality. For instance, isolated populations can and will perish in a black-swan catastrophe, so migration between habitats (incl' refugia - 'eggs in more than one basket') is necessary for conservation.</small>

But to document a numerical inquiry satisfactorily requires an intimate correspondence between equations, experimental method, and code. The [notebook paragdim](UPLOAD manifesto) is the most satisfactory approach I've come across, not least because Jupyter notebooks (unlike Matlab, which requires a proprietary viewer) can be *freely shared* online.

<sidenote>Reproducibility</sidenote>

<small>No amount of information is satisfactory without context - consider any Wikipedia article from a technical discipline adjacent to yours. Yet academic and scientific cultures have traditionally been bottlenecked by college acceptance (and the cost of tuition, and the distracted advisors caught in publish-or-perish...), even though without their uniquely evidence-based reasoning, we browse blindly or according to authority alone.</small>
