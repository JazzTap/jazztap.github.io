Jasmine Otto is a computational mathematician interested in reifications of complex systems, especially through constellated scientific practice, involving the rhetorics of dimensionality reduction and data visualization as well as narrative context. She is exploring the role of computational creativity in these sociotechnical ecologies, including existing and future uses of casual creator support and narrated explorable models.

This is my portfolio blog.

I studied mathematical biology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and am now a PhD student in the Creative Coding Lab at UC Santa Cruz.

I am interested in computer improvisation, and lifelike emergent phenomena. For instance, generative design of collective behavior & and saddle points (qualitative differences from small perturbations).

I build complex systems models with humane interfaces, aiming to improve user experiences of science, through computation and storytelling. I sketch science with code.

My creative writing is influenced by the lightness of nature's proving qualities, and the retelling of myths as grounding for uncivilization.
