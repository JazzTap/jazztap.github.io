# Scores and Recipes

This review will cover the history of currently active software instrument scenes, including both computational notebooks (a form of literate programming) and explorable explanations.

## Survey of Graphical Instruments (Historical Work)
        
### DESIGN: the hands-on essay

A proliferation of interactive visualizations is available from outlets including the New York Times graphics desk. Let's tour the 'explorable explanations' art scene that uses these tools to do fun things with informative material, not least by making the data that it's about possible to poke and prod.

Alan Kay secured funding for the Communication Design Group (CDG) in 2013, and hired Dan Ingalls (his collaborator on Smalltalk), Vi Hart (then working at Khan Academy), and Bret Victor (formerly working at Apple) to run it \cite{https://tashian.com/articles/dynamicland/}.

#### A Humane, Dynamic Medium

Bret Victor's work is linked on the explorabl.es site curated by Nicky Case (and many collaborators \cite{https://github.com/explorableexplanations/explorableexplanations.github.io#explorable-explanations}), in particular his influential piece 'Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction' from 2011.

Kay wanted to make another group like Xerox PARC [...]

#### An Expressive, Extensible Medium

Vi Hart is an artist known for her amusing educational videos about mathematics.

Vi Hart cites Reza Sarhengi, the founder of the math-art conference Bridges, as a formative influence \cite{https://theartofresearch.org/a-history/}, in the context of her decision not to study in a mathematics department but rather, in experimental music.

> I already had spent enough time in the field to know that what they teach in school captures very little of the beauty of mathematics, and I could find that elsewhere. More than I am a mathematician I am a composer...

AUTODIDACTIC and pertaining to VIDEOGAME DEVELOPMENT.

### SCIENCE: the computational dashboard

A proliferation of literate programming has been seen in .

ACADEMIC and pertaining to MATHEMATICAL RESEARCH.

## Methods of Traversing Design Space (Future Work - brief)

This section defines a domain-agnostic terminology for navigation in high-dimensional design spaces, oriented toward researchers in computational creativity producing co-creative systems, who desire the accessibility of 'casual creators' whilst respecting the deeply domain-specific structure of their computational medium.

### Explore

    to bake a cake

    to 'approach a monument'

(I think the other way to get around the burden of content-authoring is to use a type system that encodes the entire semantics.)

In practice, I have never been able to design a grammar (meaning a closed semantics that can be compiled, like an API) that is flexible and powerful enough to have expressive utility. Except in the case of learning to draw figures, which I experience as reification:

**a)** In locating a virtual, to be made actual. The strokes on the page become the silhouette of a figure projected into the camera plane, even though this figure is virtual.

(This use of 'virtual/actual' can be replaced with 'absent/present'. \cite{https://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/elljwp/deconstruction.htm})

**b)** In discovering features of the reification that I did not think of in the figure; owing to constraints, they appeared anyway. This is the difference between drawing an eye that represents an eye, or drawing an eye that defines the eye socket of the skull and thus imparts spatial orientation and proportion, in *addition* to its (relatively subtle) effect on the gestalt expression.

This phenomenon is due to the principle that 'music is made of silences', or that 'edges are dual to vertices'. (The entire list of features can reconstruct the whole, and so can the entire list of gaps between features.)

It is as though I possess a mental data structure representing the anatomy of the figure, which contains various relationships and invariants that discourage me from considering a contradictory stroke, so that I am free to select among an array of 'possible next strokes' at random, and moreover this freedom increases as I gain experience with figure drawing.

An instance of this data structure for the *subject* is what I mean by a point in design space. An effective, co-creative software partner encodes some of the skill - meaning the relationships between forms implied by strokes - sometimes literally. The Create-a-Sim sliders, for instance, operate on an entire polygonal mesh (the data structure of the *representation*), as though the strokes comprising the Sim base mesh were printed on some strange analogue of the rubber sheet on which the 'stretchy fish' of Thompson's On Growth and Form were printed.

These relationships of form are the subject of the next section, which pertains to grammar.

### Define

    to write a recipe

    to 'produce a grammatical utterance'

### Explain

    to recommend a recipe

    to 'document a work'
