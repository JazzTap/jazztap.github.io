\begin_layout Title
Navigational Instruments for Design Spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This review will cover the history of some active software instrument scenes,
 and establish the terminology of 'software instruments' referring to playful
 tools and serious toys.
 We will use the computational meta-medium in which software instruments
 are orchestrated as a means to organize skillful traversals of 
\emph on
design spaces
\emph default
 containing many useful or expressive artifacts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Survey of Graphical Instruments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, I will discuss software instruments including both computationa
l notebooks and explorable explanations.
 We'll briefly tour the 'explorable explanations' art scene, that uses these
 tools to do fun things with informative material, especially by making
 the data accessible to poking and prodding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explorable explanations are an increasingly popular form among independent
 researchers and educators, especially in the spaces of videogame design
 and machine learning.
 Computational notebooks are a form of self-documenting script-based workflow
 which has gained popularity among lab scientists as well as computer scientists.
 These scenes are currently producing novel 
\emph on
computational mediums
\emph default
 suited to the definition, exploration, and exposition of a vast variety
 of complex subjects.

In How To Snakes (Vimeo, republished from YouTube, 2011) 
\backslash
cite{https://vimeo.com/147792656}, Vi Hart demonstrates the use of a modular
 plastic snake toy as a tool for recreational mathematics and personal expressio
n, with affordances such as: - wearing the snakes - dropping the snakes
 - making a space-filling fractal curve - jumping rope with a snake - wearing
 snake as a mustache - stop-motion game of Snake (1976) - configuration
 space of snakes in terms of 'left' 'right' and 'forward', similar to Logo
 - but snakes can't run into themselves, so how many valid configurations
 are there? - binary encoding with two-color snakes - fractal snake (for
 each head you cut off, add two) - wearing the snakes on your fingers and
 making them longer - stop-motion game of Snake but the snake runs into
 itself and dies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This video is 2:09 minutes long, and elegantly connects space-filling curves
 with group theory (of valid snake configurations, called 'slithers'), while
 also making light of the somewhat arbitrary definition of a slither.
 While slithers ares shown to be extensible beyond 90-degree turns, they
 are also clearly irrelevant to cases where the snake is a mustache (or
 otherwise functioning as a 3D physics object), let alone a hydra (or otherwise
 incorporating a branching operator that rapidly fills up 2D configuration
 space).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above affordances are listed in the same order as presented in the video.
 Concepts are introduced after concepts they depend on, which are introduced
 after motivating examples, which also serve as periods of reduced tension,
 supporting the surrealistic narrative arc.
 It is clear that any hinged modular toy could have been used to convey
 these concepts, except that it hinges on a cultural reference involving
 snakes, and that it is really very fun to chant 'snake'.

In this section, I will discuss in depth two unique instruments for navigating
 design spaces: a casual creator from the popular Sims series which defines
 the facial features of expressive virtual avatars, and a computerized oracle
 deck which unfolds as a nonlinear narrative in a mode of reflection upon
 an inexpressible tragedy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper on The Sims 3 Create-A-Sim (CAS) was presented at the Casual Creators
 Workshop at the Conference on Computational Creativity in 2020.
 It contributes a model of the avatar creator containing both an inner evaluatio
n loop (where a vector of weights defines a facial geometry of the avatar),
 and an outer evaluation loop (where the user perceives the character represente
d by the avatar going about their Sim life), where execution occurs as often
 as the user chooses to revise or update their Sim.

Entering the Design Space of Digital Portraiture:

A Case Study in Avatar Creation Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We describe creativity support tools for digital portraiture in terms of
 their design spaces, which conveniently possess both a high-dimensional
 linear space of representations, and a highly expressive nonlinear space
 of referents.
 Using the casual creators tropes of parameterization and paper dolls, we
 investigate how distinct 'face spaces' are made playable by these tools
 and toys.
 We consider in depth The Sims 3's Create-A-Sim mode, a 3D avatar creator
 whose expressive range is further expanded by a modding community through
 intentional and highly technical interventions.
 Finally, we connect these skills to practices using professional creativity
 support tools for digital portraiture.
 We argue that the skillful practice of creating beautiful and evocative
 avatars is encoded simultaneously in software tools and in artistic communities
, enabling a form of conversation between the portrait artist and their
 medium.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Art students undertake years of life drawing to learn how to capture human
 likenesses in graphite and clay.
 Yet videogames which allow players to create their own character must somehow
 facilitate avatar creation by novice users, without making a hash of their
 first attempt with an unfamiliar system.
 Therefore, videogames with avatar customization invariably supply a combination
 of 'known good' starting avatars, and possibly an additional system of
 procedural modification 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These systems enable the exploration of a certain 'face space' - far being
 from the only one that exists, but certainly compatible with e.g.
 facial animations specific to the game, - which may not contain only good
 avatars.
 Indeed, more permissive editors tend to be capable of producing a wide
 variety of 'monstrous' faces.
 The humorous exploration and celebration of these possibilities formed
 the premise of the 'Monster Factory' Let's Play series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This paper will explore an argument that the existence and accessibility
 of these distressing and typically unintended results is indeed necessary
 and co-constitutive of the value in a creativity support system for digital
 software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make this claim, we need to describe both the technical and
 expressive dimensions of portraiture.
 We will focus on the case of 3D polygon-based avatars, because this is
 the current technological standard for roleplaying games produced by major
 studios, and in order to use The Sims 3 (TS3) as our case study.
 While 2D avatars present a compelling example in the domains of videogaming,
 tabletop roleplaying, and social media, we leave a detailed exploration
 to the craft literature of the respective software, and therefore leave
 their technical description aside.

\begin_layout Standard
Faces are highly expressive, able to convey aesthetic judgement

.
 Since our computers aren't, they need either very well-fitted manifolds
 in order to navigate 'face space', or a modestly good fit and a human pilot.
 And if it's fun for the human to lend their knowledge of face space and
 its strange boundaries to the computer, then perhaps it's more fun for
 them to refine that knowledge co-creatively.

 characterizes various synthetic manifolds (i.e.
 the expressive range of a generative model) embedded in a (universal) face
 space equipped with the perceptual distance between any two human faces,
 and develops a minimal 20-dimensional 'face space' of silhouetted face
 profiles which are suitable as visual stimuli for cognitive experiments.
 We extend this approach to describe the elaborate 'face spaces' which are
 made explorable by avatar creators in TS3 and similar games, with an eye
 toward eventually extending the work to face spaces of an illustrative
 or photographic nature (i.e.
 lacking a fundamental wireframe representation), that use either projection
 techniques (as in life drawing) or texture synthesis (as in generative
 adversarial networks).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to characterize spaces of 3D faces in the context of player creativity,
 we in fact encounter an intricate pipeline of data structures and percepts.
 We interpret an output of 'portraiture' as encompassing an entire space
 of possible images of the character represented by an avatar (see Fig.
 1, far right), which document the user's evaluation of the nonliving yet
 growing character they have represented in the game or fiction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simultaneously, we interpret an input of 'portraiture' as a particular set
 of image references (e.g.
 the face of a person from school, or from a movie, or from another videogame)
 which the user aims to reproduce, mimic, or modify using the avatar creator.
 The same artifact may evoke similar or divergent referents in different
 users, just as the 'same referent' may be represented by different artifacts
 according to different users.
 An online gallery may easily contain several different Sims of the same
 character from popular culture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both characters and artifacts exist in a semantically rich space.
 The avatar creator software incorporates certain claims about this space
 (e.g.
 'eye distance varies within this range', 'the height of the inner corner
 of each eye varies independently of the curve of the lower eyelid'), using
 a linear basis for additive recombination of facial features, and a rendering
 algorithm to permit their observation.
 The immediate visibility of features permits their recombination to be
 improvised, just as a well-crafted instrument does

 In elaborating on our Sims case study, we will see that

 interaction (i.e.
 not winnowing, but expanding representations) enters through alternation
 between gameplay and avatar creation.
 Conversely, The Sims 4 moves toward

 of the Sim face (via well-curated

, a mapping we discuss in 'mesh-based geometry'), with panels replaced by
 'coarse' and various 'detail' layers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid confusion between toys (in the case of small parameter spaces)
 and tools (in the case of very large parameter spaces, up to and including
 sculpting software), we call the avatar creation software an 'instrument'.
 Like musical instruments, they can be played more or less skillfully.
 Like analysis instruments, they provide generalizable insight into the
 character of universal face space.

The design space of portraiture is vast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Artists learning to draw in the contemporary tradition must perform mimesis
 of a reference artifact (be it the pose of a model on a stage, stock photos
 of actors, or even the drawings of master artists), and are taught to regard
 this as a productive process.
 Not only are divergences inevitable anyway, but the process of reaching
 a landmark in design space is an embodied learning experience 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Developing a method of documenting forays into the design space of portraiture

 the expressive range of the tool or composer.
 Reflective tool design

 makes an artifact of the part of an artist's skill (often discussed as
 their 'style') that is encoded into e.g.
 a basis for a certain face space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stylization is the visible evidence of a certain set of constraints on the
 region of design space that a given set of artworks (typically by a closely-kni
t group of artists) thereby explore.
 Deliberate constraints are often self-imposed.
 In Techne Theory (p.188), Staten describes design constraints as 'maze walls'
 in design space, that (at various levels of tangibility, epsecially the
 subconscious) define skillful practice itself 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "staten_techne_2019"

\end_inset

; a contoured space deeply contingent on material history.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the realm of avatar creation, these contours may arise either from the
 tools being used (e.g.
 the character creator might not have this celebrity's exact eyebrows),
 or from particular ways of using those tools (e.g.
 not using items that didn't ship with the game, in order to create 'no-CC'
 content).
 More fundamentally, the contours of universal face space are concealed
 where they align with the tool's face space, and revealed where they don't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Search methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We suggest a specific reading of artistic procedures as evolutionary algorithms
 (after Dennett, via Staten), where the face space of a given creativity
 support tool operationalizes a single level of abstraction.
 In particular, sets of landmarks in design space closely resemble the procedure
 of quality-diversity search 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gravina_procedural_2019"

\end_inset

, which maintains a set of increasingly 'good' points in various regions
 of design space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is vital to observe that interactive explorations of design space can
 be in constant communication with their perceptual landscape (equipped
 with its rugged fitness function), whereas automatic procedures are better
 at characterizing computationally intensive properties of the artifacts
 being designed.
 Nonetheless, small breaks in this interaction make a design space more
 interesting, not less.
 For instance, when a Sim has a child, even if their parameters are more
 or less evenly combined with their partner's, the ruggedness of perceptual
 space can lead to surprises (e.g.
 if the child inherits a supernatural feature).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instruments comprise a domain-specific language equipped with direct manipulatio
n, in software terms.
 Avatar creators are software instruments, and their avatars are similar
 to Montfort's 'player character ...

 While general-purpose sculpting software can be adapted for use as avatar
 creators, they produce an experience much less similar to 'steering', and
 much closer to being the vehicle responsible for a safe traversal of design
 space.

Mesh-based geometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Meshes consist of a set of points in 3D space, connected by edges forming
 triangles which discretize a surface.
 Surfaces that are roughly egg-shaped, but possessing eye sockets and a
 jawline, can be said to resemble skulls.
 With the appropriate proportions and elaborations, eventually a face will
 emerge.
 Meanwhile, each vertex position should be chosen thoughtfully, to minimize
 the number of triangles in the resulting surface (to minimize the difficulty
 of rendering).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may define a basis for face space as 1) a 'face mesh' of this form (including
 a fixed list of edges between vertices), and 2) a collection of 'vertex
 sliders', each consisting of a linear deformation to the positions of the
 vertices.
 In practice, certain subsets of vertices are assigned with variable weights
 to certain 'bones', allowing 'bone sliders' which deform the position,
 scale, and rotation of bones (and ergo those subsets of vertices) to produce
 more expressive mappings 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "hunt_importance_2003"

\end_inset

.
 Because these linear operations compose algebraically, all sliders are
 basis elements of the face space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Practical guides to the creation of new sliders (i.e.
 basis elements in face space) can be found in Sims modding forums

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Texture maps and lighting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Diffuse texture maps model the response of each point on the surface to
 direct illumination, i.e.
 what color is reflected.
 Normal texture maps allow bumps and other surface details to be added to
 the mesh surface without changing the number of vertices.
 The combination of these comprises one possible 'complexion' or 'skintone'.

 The relationship of The Sims as a series and of its various communities
 to this rhetoric is complex.
 In this paper, we aim to avoid reliance on on the intensive character of
 'realistic' avatar creation, as we are concerned with a separate form of
 'skill' encoded into a face space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet the evaluation of a face space will necessarily depend upon its rendering.
 A relatively heavily-produced game such as The Sims (or Skyrim) affords
 strong curiosity about face space, especially insofar as what needs to
 be fixed is made evident.
 Indeed, dissatisfaction with first-party textures can itself drive custom

Sliders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sliders are categorized into five parts of the face, and divided among four
 or more panels in each part.
 Somewhere between three and a dozen sliders are available in each panel.
 By default, all of this is hidden, and avatar editing is performed using
 a gallery of examples.
 In The Sims 2, the example facial features can be right-clicked to blend
 toward them by 10%, but this resets the slider GUI for that part's axes
 (and not their values), allowing extreme features to be created without
 mods.
\end_layout

implements most of the features we will proceed to discuss, including a
 litany of bug-fixes and error traps appearing alongside changes to gameplay,
 and quality of life features such as the addition of most cheat console
 capabilities into the game UI, and the option to force Create-A-Sim (CAS)
 to display.
 In particular, this means that Sim parameterizations (including sliders,
 skintones, and other non-clothing accessories) need not be locked in, so
 that extended avatar editing remains a part of the gameplay loop.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Slider range, and caricature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NRAAS enables CAS to display an arbitrary number of custom sliders, and
 can also expand the ranges of all sliders (including those of the base
 game) by an arbitrary factor - because the value of a slider becomes the
 floating-point weight of a vector, which is not actually bounded by the
 suggested range.
 This is useful for producing humanoid characters with exaggerated or animalisti
c features, in the style of special effects makeups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Monster Factory strategem of 'no middle sliders' calls for all sliders
 to be moved, preferably to an extreme position, regardless of the result.
 This maximizes the salience of the relationship between any two sliders
 in the face space, and since these relationships produce the rugged landscape
 of the space, some of its broad contours can be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, if the eyes are way over there, what will happen to the curvature
 of the nose bridge area if we lower the brow ridge? We can try it and see.
 Maybe the brow bone is a child of the eye bone, and the entire silhouette
 of the brow region changes.
 Or maybe the brow bone is still where the eyebrows were, and the nose bridge
 ends up longer.

, these slider choices define the

 They are subject to the

\emph default
which is any deviation from pattern that destabilizes the percept by a minimal
 intervention.
 In order to locate a potential clinamen, the player-author collaborates
 with the avatar creator, in conversation with their gameplay intent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clinamen in face space depends on the highly nonlinear relationships
 between sliders, and their ensuing effects on face perception.
 (Almost all of the points in high-dimensional spaces are in 'corners',
 further from the center than extremal points along any one axis are 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.) For instance, Monster Factory begins with a garishly additive, over-detailed
 bout of character creation, which promptly lands in an odd corner.
 These avatars are then juxtaposed with the world, which the game engine
 happily furnishes their interaction with, since nothing unusual has occurred
 from its point of view.
 As a result, suspension of disbelief creeps back in, and characters emerge.

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Slider defaults, and vanilla pudding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain service roles in TS3 generate new sims with a face that isn't randomized
, but whose sliders are simply all set to zero.
 The NRAAS mods include both batch processing tools (e.g.
 by drawing from a gallery of premade Sims) and enhanced console commands
 for solving the problem (e.g.
 by loading each affected Sim into CAS, or by remixing them from other Sims
 in the neighborhood).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The activity of eliminating default faces from the neighborhood involves
 player community awareness of the face space, which is shared among players
 through this troubleshooting.

Interaction with texture maps and accessory slots

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Combining makeups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other sculpting software (e.g.
 Sculptris, 3D-Sculpt) that enables direct painting, CAS provides a variety
 of makeups (split amongst five slots), with up to four customizable color
 channels each.
 This is useful not only for eyeshadow and face-paint, but also for eyebags,
 'contact lenses' (including both costume lenses, and realistic options
 using more than one color channel), and any other feature that can be placed
 into a facial texture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NRAAS can prevent makeup from taking up its own slot, allowing arbitrary
 combinations thereof.
 Clearly, a much smaller number of 'good' design options are opened up than
 bad or pointless ones by this choice.
 Yet this is a trade-off that certain users are happy to make, which is
 not surprising - to bother with mods at all means making instrument more
 tool-like (improving user control), at the cost of making it less toy-like
 (intensifying user effort).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Iris scale and hat bones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sliders can also interact with makeup and accessories.
 For instance, the iris and pupil sliders of #aWT change the radius of these
 features (regardless of which eye texture the user has applied) by moving
 the vertices of the eye mesh.
 Modders have also created sliders for the bones to which things like hats,
 glasses, and teeth attach, that modify their position to prevent (or accomplish
) clipping through the face of a Sim with extreme features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This represents an extension of face space to accomodate specific textures
 and accessories.
 So our story about face space cannot be that it is a nice and rendering-agnosti
c characterization of expressive range.
 Rather, it is made into an evolving site of identity work, in its capacity
 as a small lab of non-narrative world-building activity, as is The Sims
 as a series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Conclusions

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Call for face spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear approximation by sliders is an imperfect but tractable method of
 modelling universal face space.
 As an analogy, consider the RGB (red-green-blue) color space, which cuts
 through the space of all possible spectral signatures (as a submanifold).
 RGB color space consists of all possible blends of only three frequencies:
 a certain red, green, and blue, which each activate their respective receptor
 in the human eye.
 But RGB is a poor representation for designers, because the hue and tone
 of a color varies wildly as red, green, and blue are added or subtracted.
 A well-chosen linear change of basis will convert RGB space into HSV (hue-satur
ation-value), or another perceptual color space, which has the same expressive
 range but is easier to navigate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain 'explainable AI' tools are designed to identify human-interpretible
 bases for expressive linear spaces.
 For instance, photorealistic 2D face spaces have enjoyed a surge of popularity
 due to recent work in generative adversarial networks (GANs).
 The SpaceSheet interface 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is in fact an avatar creator incorporating real-time user modification
 of the parameter space, represented as a spreadsheet containing a high-dimensio
nal vector in each cell, which is rendered as a point in the face space
 of the GAN.
 Unlike the paper-doll avatar creators commonly available online 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is a well-executed, very plain example of this kind of software.
 It has a substantial expressive range, but unfortunately, no landmarks
 besides the default face.
 Their most characterful slider by far is 'style', which produces avatars
 with the huge eyes and tiny necks of a Disney princess when moved from
 'real' to 'cartoon'.
 It also predominates easily over other sliders.
 Nonetheless, imagining other 'style' sliders (e.g.
 for assorted interpretations of vampires) is a fun exercise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Call for instruments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instruments are a technology that changes over time.
 Instruments are defined by their design space, as when sculpting software
 uses clay as a (visual) metaphor to describe brush-based manipulation of
 a surface mesh.
 Yet play with instruments also re-defines their design space, as when situation
s arising in a life simulation game reflect back on the avatars populating
 that space, e.g.
 via the player-author seeking out specific custom content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Reflective design
\emph default
 is a mode of design research oriented toward documenting design knowledge
 in software instruments and other intelligent interfaces 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "smith_computational_2011"

\end_inset

.
 Avatar creators are instruments of this research when they are oriented
 toward understanding a face space, meaning that they both make claims (on
 their author's behalf) and challenge them (through their users).
 Two people attempting to use the same instrument to recreate the same person
 will find surprising differences in those representations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference of avatars to a character who is important to the player,
 i.e.
 self-relevance, is a powerful means for players to understand and control
 their self-perception 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ratan_when_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Ratan and Dawson provide evidence that when 
\emph on
avatar-body disconnection
\emph default
 after use is minimized, then avatar self-relevance after use (i.e.
 during downtime) is maximized.
 By this argument, indirect control of household Sims (and AI control of
 self-relevant but non-household Sims) would actually strengthen their connectio
n to the player who isn't actively playing the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the strength of self-relevance depends on whether the design space
 of the expressive instruments in the game, including the face space of
 the avatar creator, is able to accomodate the 
\emph on
player's
\emph default
 creative range.
 Therefore, even when its face space is not the explicit subject of design
 inquiry, any life simulation game (e.g.
 the Sims-like Paralives, or the roguelike Ultima Ratio Regum 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "smith_ultima_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) depends upon it to connect deeply with its players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Call to create communities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each instrument affords a common language by which universal face space
 can be explored, allowing landmarks to be shared in the form of directions
 to them.
 Therefore, we assert that the Simming community itsel(ves) represents the
 primary good created by a platform which creates both support for novice
 creators, and room for virtuosity.
\end_layout

 of 3D massively multiplayer online roleplaying games 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, as well as in paper-doll avatar creators shared online (e.g.
 on the website 
\family typewriter
meiker.io

).
 For instance, the Mii Parade that shipped with the Wii console was a space
 in which the 3D Mii avatars could 'mingle' with Miis from other consoles
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Using the sliders to change the X/Y placement of certain features on the
 Mii's head, it was possible to create a variety of masked and alien Miis,
 e.g.
 in order to figure out how someone else had entered a certain popular character
 into a Mii competition.

\begin_layout Standard
Narrative media may vary the adjacency of fixed textual passages to drive
 rhizomatic readings through a montage procedure.
 We present the design of “exul mater”, a hypertext fiction which locates
 perlocutionary acts in virtual spaces and resonant gaps.
 We reflect on sculptural fiction, the (de)formance of complex systems,
 and tarot reading as methods of layering metaphorical blends into polysemous
 juxtapositional elements.
 "exul mater" consists of one set of such elements and their pairwise juxtaposit
ions, as presented through an interface which supports higher-order ‘gap-filling
’ reading(s).
 We draw on peer feedback to address challenges to readability arising from
 the narrative application of procedural montage.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"exul mater" is a computerized oracle deck, questioning cybernetic power
 and identity, which is performed by a querent who arranges illustrated
 cards to reveal narrative texts.
 Using combinatorial narrative, it probes the multiple faces of each figure
 in its encoded myth (heightened by tropes of science fantasy and magical
 corruption), whose contradictions and diffractions reveal their conflicted
 interiority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its central figure attempts to reconcile a series of illegible tragedies
 with the totalizing scientific ontology which enabled these self-same triumphs
 to occur.
 The mutual incompatibility of these multiple truths is destabilizing, leading
 to a simultaneous and escalating aggrandizement and loathing of her loved
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spaces in between its figures are sites of escape, of experiences that
 have not been reconfigured by a colonizing form of military-industrial
 technology.
 This rationalizing influence invades their moments together and animates
 the material forces that tear them apart, attempting merely to form neat
 strata.
 This deck argues against clinging to powerful stories for too long, and
 in favor of messy stories which fail to privilege any one reading, which
 can disrupt the imbalanced synthesis of history.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We describe "exul mater", a short web-based story in a branching, card-based
 format.
 We consider the properties of this narrative system which induce apophenia,
 the eager perception of connections and meaning in unordered collections
 of like things (e.g.
 seeing strokes as forming letters, or letters as forming words).
 Its reader is invited to reminisce upon an immutable collection of events,
 which nonetheless may yield many different stories, as a querent would
 receive meaningfully different readings from the same tarot deck.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We locate "exul mater" amongst analog forms of procedural narrative, which
 include tarot reading, shuffle literature (Montfort and Husárová), and
 other games of order or causality (Short, "Card-Deck Narratives").
 Although a linear causality of events exists in "exul mater", it is not
 surfaced by our narrative's text, which more closely resembles a sequence
 of frame stories.
 This work does not attempt to complete a telling regardless of the reader's
 path, but instead presents each route as a deformance (McGann and Samuels)
 of the virtual space of narratives encoded by the deck.
 Our reader is thus encouraged to perform narrative between the scenes,
 within the constraint of which cards exist in their hand, to locate events
 whose significance was hidden.
 In this paper, we present the design of "exul mater", along with feedback
 from peer researchers of narrative design and visual culture.
 In the following text, quotes from this written correspondence are provided
 at the beginning of each section in gray intertext.

Construction

\begin_layout Standard
Our method of polysemous elements and productive gaps attempts to make a
 fixed topology of narrative content open-ended, by letting the reader select
 imprecisely among multiple selections of its scenes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"exul mater" uses a concordance-like textual layout.
 Multiple scenes are laid out in alignment with each other, and are overlaid
 by the cards determining them (per 'Edge selections' below).
 Recent scene texts remain in alignment, faded out, until their card is
 completely replaced.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cards are illustrated, representing characters (persons, institutions, or
 worlds) or themes (creatures, sites, or abstract concepts).
 As the text interrogates progress and hybridity through mythic tragedy,
 we ground out to images of sorceresses and their familiars.

\begin_layout Standard
Each pair of cards induces one scene, which represents a missive, reflection,
 or something else epistolary.
 When one card in a two-card spread is replaced, the previous scene text
 is placed to the side and faded (but not completely hidden).
 If the new text was faded (rather than absent), it is revealed in place.
 Otherwise, its movement would disrupt reading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present the cards in a fixed branching sequence.
 After each choice of a card by the reader, we discard the alternative (if
 any) and reveal one or two new cards (which are predetermined).
 In order to view alternative routes, the reader can rewind to the top of
 the deck at any time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each route of four cards corresponds to six scenes: respectively, the vertices
 and edges of a tetrahedron.
 Each edge is adjacent to four edges (two by replacing each card), while
 the sixth and opposite edge could be reached in two moves, using only two-card
 spreads.
 (Routes of more than four cards would imply higher dimensional simplices,
 and their respective combinatorics.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although one-card spreads are trivial (no scene is revealed), three-card
 and four-card spreads are also possible.
 If three cards are present, then three pairs are present, and each of their
 scenes is revealed simultaneously.
 (This triple is one face of the tetrahedron, so each adjacent face shares
 one scene.) If any one card is removed, both pairs broken are faded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If four cards are present, then all six pairs are revealed.
 Removing one card breaks three pairs.
 Because all four cards are opaque and take up screen space, it is unlikely
 that all revealed scenes will be readable.
 The deformance necessarily performed by the reader is thereby made visible.

\begin_layout Standard
Because they can return to their previous position by a simple series of
 actions, the reader is encouraged in a circular motion of review, similar
 to other shuffle literature (Montfort and Husárová) in its reflective framing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional tarot decks likewise encode a vast virtual space of readings
 into the combinatorics of various spreads of cards.
 Tarot spreads produce a superimposition of orderings designed to draw out
 intuitive answers to personal questions (Parrish) (Manning, "Tarot as Procedura
l Storytelling").
 The range of possible and plausible readings from any tarot spread are
 malleable through the use of decks with varied suites, names, and imagery
 (Short, "Expressive Range in Tarot Decks").
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our system in "exul mater" is an example of sculptural fiction (Reed, "Changeful
 Tales") where the reader performs the work, whilst the author designs the
 space it may occupy.
 Such work creates apophenia - the recognition of patterns or subtext -
 inevitably, yet at unpredictable moments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, Fallen London (Failbetter Games) is a browser-based persistent-pro
gression game with occult themes, which implies to the player a more extensive
 and involved world than could be directly implemented.
 Because it plays out daily over the course of actual years, the user has
 time to prod at the seams of that world, and it may grow to fill the available
 mental space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We claim the polysemous juxtapositional elements in any given apophenic
 fiction are in fact interwoven and mutually reinforcing.
 "If you hammer a nail into a piece of wood, the wood has a different resistance
 according to the place you attack it: we say that wood is not isotropic.
 Neither is the text: the edges, the seam, are unpredictable." (Barthes,
 36).
 Tarot decks, especially, are in diffraction (Barad) with themselves - each
 of their elements with another possesses constructive or destructive resonances.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Contradictory orderings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We imagine the four voiced characters in exul mater as flickering signifiers
 (Raley, quoting Hayles).
 By allowing the presentation of each figure to vary widely between their
 scenes, which sit in an indeterminate order, they may "present [themselves]
 as a constantly refreshed image".
 Their polysemy is actually located in this variability, as much as their
 illustration(s) seek to surface it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our aesthetic goal is to enable many readings of literally the same scene,
 just as the montage effect describes a single face read with different
 expressions for what shots flanked it.
 We describe actual variation between, and imply virtual variation underneath,
 each presentation in each scene.
 This gestures at the performative fiction of identity, as undertaken by
 people attempting to be recognized as characters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reader may rearrange scenes (edges) in exul mater at will, within their
 current spread, which is topologically a simplex (i.e.
 a triangle of three cards, or a tetrahedron of four cards, and so on).
 Mere juxtaposition can produce virtual narrative (King) that is imagined
 yet unwritten, that is present without happening.
 By different elements of the scenes being diffracted with their neighbors,
 so every reading of the text is performed by reader intervention.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, any spread of three cards will produce a triple of texts.
 "Neighboring stories" of this form share two cards.
 But not all triples are neighbors, resulting in textural gaps.
 In addition, the branching selection of cards reveals rival interpretations,
 by various shifts of perspective.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each scene in "exul mater" is triggered by and comments on the relationship
 between two cards, typically in the form of a character addressing another
 character about their involvement in it.
 Relationships can be as simple as murder - because such acts foreclose
 on future possibilities, thus dictating causality - or as complex as vengeance.
 The relationship, as a perlocutionary act, emerges from those acts it implies
 and is implied by (Blommaert, 22).
 But in a puzzle whose solution is "love", the only word prohibited is "love"
 (Borges, 34).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the same character may act in many different capacities, then even small
 casts imply very many different scenes.
 But the ideal place to position a scene is at a saddle point (a narrative
 watershed, from which outcomes diverge), where relationships are about
 to be reconfigured.
 Human readers are excellent at interpolating in between, imagining how
 a character reached point B from A - we may imagine fraught months of deception
, from only the evening the spies nearly were caught.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plot may be seen as a scheme to exhaust every interesting configuration
 of a relationship.
 This is clearest when a climactic scene teeters over the saddle point toward
 tragedy (e.g.
 the protagonist at the altar entering a loveless marriage), only to swerve
 back again.
 We propose that a virtual form of this other world exists if and only if
 the reader was made to pause and think of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the narrative motion experienced by the remaining scene (out of
 three) when one card out of three is changed.
 This effect can be causally productive, enacting a cut (Barad), by changing
 e.g.
 the reason for an action taken, or the outcome of those choices.
 Following this action, the revealed text now has a virtual counterpart,
 a might-have-been.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We call the movement between adjacent spreads a triangle closure, alluding
 to the more general form of narrative closure, as found between successive
 panels in a comic book (McCloud).
 These near-misses, layered upon each other, together comprise a set of
 alternative causalities, which we regard as a re-reading.

Productive gaps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calvino's combinatorial approach in The Castle of Crossed Destinies (Cannon)
 generates a multiplicity of plots from spreads of the popular Rider-Waite
 tarot (a deck of playing cards including the set of character archetypes
 known as the major arcana).
 Any given card possesses no single reading - rather, its meaning lies outside
 of itself, in its order with its neighbors.
 Yet the mere presence of unused cards in a narrative might entice the reader
 to find further nuance inside of the idea that a given iteration has presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These 'productive gaps' are lacunae (Manning, on lacunae), narrative elements
 which exist at the margins of the work, whether in friction with its meaning,
 or by visibly failing to exist.
 Lacunae are virtual, located in between texts, as apophenia and intuited
 connections.
 They are typical of narrative metacognition, as Calvino demonstrated by
 compelling his characters to read each others' stories, with no ability
 to negotiate a 'correct' reading amongst themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Triangle closures, as a movement between readings of flickering signifiers,
 are themselves a meaningful gap which the reader may be driven to account
 for.
 Our aesthetic goal is (additionally) to enable many readings of literally
 the same spread, as the reader settles on one possible causal interpretation,
 especially if we cannot predict or even account for that interpretation
 (Kumari et al.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Recombinatorial engines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shuffle literature plays with polysemy and metaphorical blending, similarly
 to the mathematical intuition underlying a proof, in which exists an intricate
 contingency of the metaphorical blends (Lakoff and Núñez) forming each
 entity: "[...] the proof always springs from the insight, and not the other
 way round - and that the insight itself has its source [...] in a delicate
 and obstinate feeling of the relevant entities and concepts and their mutual
 relations." (Grothendieck) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current works of digital narrative also deploy lacunae and resonance to
 locate the pleasures of rearranging a text, as demonstrated by the following
 two examples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Telling Lies (Barlow) presents its topology through a heavily diegetic search
 interface, which relies on the gaps created by revealing only the five
 videos earliest in its timeline whose transcript contains a keyword match
 for any given query.
 In an operationalized variety of deformance (McGann and Samuels), the reader
 is forced to arrange the most meaningful series of records that could exist
 for them at each moment, bootstrapping their knowledge of the characters
 and their relations from nothing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ice-Bound Concordance (Reed et al.) casts the player as the assistant
 to a posthumous author, who has written a novel but cannot arrange it.
 The virtual space of all the novels that could be written is explicitly
 the object of inquiry.
 Mechanically, the subset of sockets (cards) selected enables certain events
 (scenes) in each chapter, by certain boolean combinations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ice-Bound presents a small subset of the possible tokens for each chapter,
 so that the reader has no hope of realizing all of its plots without revisit.
 To lock in any given theme (which unblocks future sockets) at the end of
 chapter, the player must search the companion book for imagery, sealed
 documents, and ephemera from the digital author's life, filling the lacuna
 ("where did this idea germinate?") with a resonant image or story.

Playtester feedback has revealed various issues of obscurity in "exul mater"

 without its key.
 We consider possible remedies to the confusion engendered by our context-depend

\begin_layout Standard
"exul mater" represents its cards as selected major arcana, and identifies
 each with a character.
 Cards are the common threads between multiple scenes, and together produce
 an emotional, thematic palette for the world in the story.
 A card is an original illustration (with character-specific imagery) paired
 to a short epithet, which may either name a character unambiguously, or
 else a suitable major arcana.
 (The name of the archetype is contingent on the card's position in the
 text, as the same illustration can have many names.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We label the observer of each scene in the style of a script.
 A fixed point of view is infeasible when no single character is aware of
 all the scenes we need to establish each saddle point in the complex system
 which we portray them as navigating.
 Even characters observing the same scene will necessarily have different
 interpretations, which are desirable to contrast.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As character relations need only be revealed one or two at a time, each
 scene is only three paragraphs.
 Even shorter passages (ideally down to 100-word drabbles) would exert greater
 juxtapositional force, but are more difficult to ground out to characters.
 Whereas lyricism and emotional resonance require quick identification of
 specific characters in various guises.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And we don't even know if the reader knows a certain name for a character,
 or a certain relation of theirs.
 Any ambiguity in which name means which character is potentially counterproduct
ive.
 Yet it arises naturally through both the multiplicity of individual characters
 (leading to a proliferation of names), and direct parallels between the
 relationships of various characters (i.e.
 repeating patterns, rhyming plots).

Further iteration on the work led to a drag-and-drop interface (choose m
 out of n cards), which is the most common representation of subset selection
 in shuffle literature.
 We also tried interfaces using fixed slots (put n lights in m sockets,
 as in Ice-Bound), or a set of switches (m out of n can be active together,
 as in multiple-selection lists), or a rotating simplex (let the camera
 face m out of n vertices, with purely theoretical precedent).
 None were as legible.

The possibilities of interpreted spatial proximity, beyond excluding cards
 occluded by others, remain latent.

Other forms of description folding on keywords or short phrases include
 hover text (e.g.

 Hover text fragments can cause their hidden referent (a footnote, or a
 linked article) to appear beside the text.
 Shimmer text fragments can be cycled through a few authored variations,
 and may include character creation choices, collapsible summaries, or reframing
s of perspective (e.g.
 Reed et al.'s Ice-Bound).
 Each mode of juxtaposition is expressive and produces its own resonances.

The scene texts in "exul mater" carry the weight of both carrying a literal
 scene and producing figurative resonances.
 These fragments easily become alienating unless the card images are very
 literal.
 Rather than describe an intersection of scenes, these are more like entities
 that carry between scenes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our scenes are not written from single words; each relationship between
 characters has emotional overtones, so we used song lyrics interleaved
 as couplets to prompt each scene.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In "exul mater", using figures who ascribe different forms of villainy to
 each other, whose actions are forced by systems which they each articulate
 differently, we seek to describe systemic violence.
 Between scenes are the saddle points upon which those tragedies are willingly
 replicated.
 The beliefs and traits of each participating entity must cohere; they should
 prove the unexpected coexistence of certain roles, and so articulate what
 cannot be systematized (Raley).

Future plans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We anticipate seeing more and more shuffle literature incorporated into
 narrative games, especially those seeking to be highly replayable, yet
 being limited by the cost of content, or by the burden of avoiding self-contrad
iction (due to statefulness).
 In future works, we plan to investigate further structuring interface elements,
 beyond the prompts.
 Perhaps scenes can be indicated as events upon a timeline, or character
 aliases can be called out with a contextualizing highlight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"exul mater" is available online.
 It was prototyped using the ObservableHQ, which supports interactive recombinat
ion of elements.
 While authoring, this allows us to see the selected text alongside the
 juxtaposed images, and to edit text with zero recompilation delay.
 However, the prototyping notebook is a general-purpose tool.
 While our code is open-source (using a flat representation of scene text,
 inspired by Inkle's ink langage), it is not a well-documented authoring
 tool.
 Because the structure of branching simplices is distinct from the locative
 fiction supported by existing sculptural hypertext authoring (Kitromili
 et al.), we may extend our notebook to facilitate authoring new decks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We look forward to seeing the craft of flickering signifiers continue to
 be developed in procedural formats, inspired by both the capacities of
 modern hypertext, and traditional forms of magic and myth-making.
