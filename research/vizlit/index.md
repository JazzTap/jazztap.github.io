Work to be presented at the CHI '24 Workshop on Visualization Literacy, May 11, 2024, Honolulu, HI.

## ABSTRACT
This paper argues for computational notebooks as examples of paper tools. Through generative theories of interaction, I read notebooks as sites of creative data-driven visualization practices, and as sites where visualization literacy can be taught. Notebooks are both generative pipelines and sites of collaboration with data. Notebooks enable reflective practitioners to discover connections between multiple levels of abstraction through self-directed visualization processes. The sociotechnical characteristics of visualization notebooks enable them to function as paper tools, supporting rapid iteration on visualization design tasks by both experts and trainees. Ultimately, specific paper tools enable us to define criteria for visualization literacy.

## Introduction
This paper identifies visualization literacy as a desiderata of \textit{programming tools} which are used to create visualization systems. To make this argument, I will recruit 1) theories of technical literacy, focusing on \textit{paper tools} and \textit{instrumental interaction}, which will be reflected in successful visualization designs; and 2) existing programming environments, especially \textit{computational notebooks}, which serve expert and trainee visualization developers' \textit{reflective design} needs. Ultimately, this paper draws novel connections between prior theories of computer-supported collaboration and interaction design, through concrete examples of end-user programming in a visualization research context.

**Figure 1:** A Venn diagram with three circles labelled a) Visualization Systems, b) Programming Systems, and c) Paper Tools (which is highlighted). The intersections of pairs of circles are labelled (ab) Widgets, (bc) Computational Notebooks, (ac) Diagrams). At the center (abc), there is no ultimate label, but instead a question mark.

**Caption:** Genres of artifact which participate in reflective sense-making processes. By distinguishing \textit{paper tools} from other forms of visualization and/or programming systems, I intend to orient conversations about visualization literacy towards \textit{what falls in the center}.
