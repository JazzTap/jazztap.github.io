Autopoiesis: a Model, of 'nuclei in vesicles' based roughly on (Varela, Maturana, Uribe) @ doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-0718-9_40

If the system is *closed off* by removing the tiny spontaneous generation term, then Catalysts will eventually go extinct due to bad luck (entropy).

(The expected time horizon for extinction is hard to derive, being an emergent property. Observe that survival rates improve when Catalysts find each other.)

N.b. this cellular automaton is running on World in Emoji (Nicky Case).
