[**exul mater**](https://projects.cah.ucf.edu/mediaartsexhibits/uncontinuity/Otto/exulmater/index.html) is a computerized oracle deck, questioning cybernetic power and identity. it was presented at [**(un)continuity**](https://projects.cah.ucf.edu/mediaartsexhibits/uncontinuity/Otto/otto.html), a curated exhibition at ELO 2020. originally scheduled to convene in Orlando, Florida, the exhibition was moved online due to pandemic.

you will reveal the text by arranging cards. in this myth, each figure has many faces. they are witches and lovers, soldiers and mothers, and they cannot always perform themselves consistently.

the *querent* aims to reconcile the tragedies that her family and her nation have suffered, and create a story that is legible. to do so, she must use the same totalizing language in which those self-same events represent triumph and progress. she is destabilized by holding both truths.

as she regards the figures of her loved ones, her feelings cycle between adoration and hatred, always escalating. the spaces between them are sites of escape, instead. unlike their stories, these gaps cannot be broken by the technologies of war, and thus brought into order. stolen moments cannot so easily be reconfigured, and rationalized, and conquered by their *hero*.

do not cling to powerful stories for too long, the deck says, out of mourning. seek out messy stories, that might not privilege one reading over others.
