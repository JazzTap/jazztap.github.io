[**exul mater**](https://projects.cah.ucf.edu/mediaartsexhibits/uncontinuity/Otto/otto.html) is a computerized oracle deck, questioning cybernetic power and identity. it was presented at [**(un)continuity**](https://projects.cah.ucf.edu/mediaartsexhibits/uncontinuity/index.html), a curated exhibition at ELO 2020. originally scheduled to convene in Orlando, Florida, the exhibition was moved online due to pandemic.

you will reveal the text by arranging cards. in this myth, each figure has many faces. they are witches and lovers, soldiers and mothers, in contradiction with themselves, so always re-representing themselves. consequently, the cards will show another story each time.

the fictive querent aims to reconcile a series of tragedies, that her family and her nation have each suffered, into a story that is legible. to do so, she would use the same totalizing language in which those self-same events represent triumph and progress. she is destabilized by holding both truths, which brings about her corruption thus.

she circles between adoration and hatred, passing around the figures of her loved ones. the spaces between them are sites of escape. their experiences are unlike their lives, because they cannot be broken by war and its technologies. they cannot easily be reconfigured, rationalized, and conquered from within.

do not cling to powerful stories for too long, the deck says. seek out messy stories, which fail to privilege one reading over others. those stories can disrupt the imbalanced synthesis of history, and the flawed logic of inevitability.
