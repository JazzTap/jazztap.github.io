To host:

Serve the following directory structure from the desired path:

- index.html
- index.js
- release.js
- favicon.ico
- assets
    - {d3.v5.min, runtime}.js
    - {wing.min, inspector}.css
    - {bg, devil, emperor, forge_, grail, guardian_, idyll, imbrication, lantern, moth, orbit, priestess}.png

where curly brackets denote multiple files, delimited by ', '.

To test:

Please use a current version of Chrome or Firefox. The computer should have a touchscreen ideally, and at least a mouse.

The files can be served from either a remote site (requiring internet access), or hosted locally (requiring a Python installation to run an HTTP server).
